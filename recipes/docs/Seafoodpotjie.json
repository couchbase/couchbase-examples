Often the legs were sewn down so that it could also be used on a black coal stove. The rounded base ensured that the juices accumulated at the base of the pot near the heat, cooking the stew to perfection. We suggest you use a large pan on the hob!","totaltime":"35","cooktime":"25","ingredients":[{"ingredient":"butter","measure":"25 g"},{"ingredient":"vegetable oil","measure":"3 tsp"},{"ingredient":"large onion","measure":"1"},{"ingredient":"garlic","measure":"2 cloves"},{"ingredient":"ground coriander","measure":"1 tsp"},{"ingredient":"cayenne pepper","measure":"[sup]1[/sup]/[sub]2[/sub] tsp"},{"ingredient":"ground cinnamon","measure":"[sup]1[/sup]/[sub]2[/sub] tsp"},{"ingredient":"celery","measure":"2 sticks"},{"ingredient":"long grain rice","measure":"100 g"},{"ingredient":"tomato puree","measure":"6 tsp"},{"ingredient":"juice of # lemon","measure":""},{"ingredient":"dry white wine","measure":"500 ml"},{"ingredient":"seasoning","measure":""},{"ingredient":"bay leaves","measure":"2"},{"ingredient":"monkfish tail","measure":"450 g"},{"ingredient":"mussels","measure":"12"},{"ingredient":"raw tiger prawn","measure":"1"},{"ingredient":"fresh basil","measure":"3 tsp"}],"method":[{"step":"1","text":"Melt the butter with the oil in a large saucepan.
